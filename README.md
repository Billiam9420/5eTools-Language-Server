# 5eTools Language Server

Available at both:
- VSCode: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=revilowaldow.5etools-language-server
- VSCo~p~*d*ium: https://open-vsx.org/extension/revilowaldow/5etools-language-server

A massive ripoff of [GoR](https://github.com/Git-GoR/5e-homebrew-snippets) and [Tree's](https://github.com/Jklein64/5e-syntax) extensions (both MIT), taking what I believe to be the best of both, and dropping the rest.

## Notable changes:

- This extension provides the JSON schema validation directly
- No more duplicate tags
- Updated source and tag lists
- Added more tags
- Added a $schema snippet

## Longer Term Goals

- Look into making this user customisable
  - User specified Homebrew Sources for Highlighting
  - User specified matching for schema
- Look into adding direct dependencies on 5e modules, for e.g. automatic source list updating

## Example Features

Content autofill/suggestions and error checking from the schema, as well as syntax highlighting for 5eTools style tags.
